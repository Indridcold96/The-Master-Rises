The first gap would be why the enclave didn't help their members on earth, simple, because the first and most strict law of the space project was to avoid exposition AT ALL COSTS, so aparently Autumn junior contacted his father for backup, however not only he did not aprove his plan to conquer project purity but he also couldn't send reinforcements even if he wanted to , but he reestablished control over Bradley Hercules and gave special acess to them, however they would need antennas to use it, so the actual reason for them to get to the mobile base was to use the orbital weapon.But, of course, only Colonel Autumn knew that and he wouldn't tell the other members of the enclave. Tension began to grow among the group, so some members started "deserting" and wandering off,l so actually the enclave branch in the Capital Wastes was fractured EVEN before their clash with the brotherood, but of course, such things can't become public, so they did everything they could to keep this a secret and to ensure that other people wouldn't leave. Strict policies were applied and, as the time passed, Autumn would grow more and more nervous, he couldn't think rationally anymore, so much that when they did their last stand for project purity, a lot of soldiers just fled the place, abandoning their frustrated leader, only the most loyal remained. After the death of Autumn junior, the comanding officers from squad sigma began to "rebuild" enough force to maintain their operations, contact with the space station was lost, after all, they did not know of it's existence and the only person who did was now dead...i could continue to detail things but you get my point, anyway i just hope everything turns out okay, ty again for this lore video and keep posting, you're doing great!
